1. Data Import: Imported the employee dataset into Power BI.
2. Data Cleaning: Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. Creating Custom Columns: Used DAX to create custom columns for enhanced data analysis.
4. Visualization: Selected appropriate visualizations such as clustered bar charts and graph charts to represent the data effectively.
5. Filters: Added filters to allow interactive exploration of the data.

Through this analysis, I was able to uncover several key insights:
- Insight 1: We can better manage expenses
- Insight 2: Monitoring financial health
- Insight 3: Analysing total reimbursed amount,etc.
